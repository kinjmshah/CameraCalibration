# Augmented Reality Assignment 2

The "assignment2.py" file is all encompassing for my assignment.

To run:
1. ensure you are in a python3 enabled environment with OpenCV dependencies installed.
2. execute the command python3 assignment2.py
3. the final outputs for all files will be printed on the command line
4. execute print.py for streamlined command line output

The file contains the following functions:
1. getFileNames
2. evaluateImages
3. reProjectionError
4. singleCamCalibratino
5. stereoCalib_2cam

Plotting occurs in the main run of the function and 5 images will be output (1 for dataset 1, 2 for dataset 2, 2 for dataset 3).
